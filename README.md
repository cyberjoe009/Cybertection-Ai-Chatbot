Rule-Based System: This example uses a simple dictionary (self.responses) to store rules. If the user's message contains a keyword, a random response from the corresponding list is chosen.
Default Response: A default response is provided if no rule matches.
Lowercase Conversion: The user's input is converted to lowercase to make the keyword matching case-insensitive.
